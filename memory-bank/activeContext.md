# Monopoly Deal Active Context

## Current Work Focus

1. ✅ **Card Click Functionality**: Fixed issue where card clicks result in "Cannot play this card right now" message
2. ✅ **Card Playability**: Resolved issues with the isCardPlayable function
3. **UI Feedback**: Improved feedback when cards are clicked
4. ✅ **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to identify issues

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Card Playability**: Added proper reset of `hasDrawnCards` in the `resetGameState` function
2. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging in the card click handler for better troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. Test that card action modals appear properly
2. Verify that the game state updates correctly when cards are played
3. Ensure all card types can be played correctly
4. Add additional error handling for edge cases

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Card Click Handling

Fixed issues with:

- Click events are now being properly processed
- Card data attributes are correctly set
- The isCardPlayable variable is now correctly calculated

### 2. Card Playability Logic

Fixed by ensuring:

- The conditions for card playability are correctly implemented (especially hasDrawnCards)
- The game state checks (turn, cards played, etc.) are working
- The player perspective is correctly considered in the check

### 3. Debug Improvements

We have:

- Added more detailed logging
- Clearly identified reasons why cards cannot be played
- Provided better user feedback

## Key Issue Fixed

The key issue we identified and fixed was in the resetGameState function:

```js
function resetGameState() {
  // ...existing code...

  // CRITICAL FIX: Reset hasDrawnCards to false - this was missing and causing cards to not be playable
  gameState.hasDrawnCards = false;

  // ...rest of function...
}
```

This fix ensures that when a new game starts, the hasDrawnCards flag is properly reset, which allows cards to be played after drawing.
