## Recent Fixes

### Card Playability Fix (February 26, 2024)

We identified and fixed the card playability issue:

1. The problem was that hasDrawnCards was not being reset in the resetGameState function
2. This caused the isCardPlayable check to fail even when it should succeed
3. The fix was adding `gameState.hasDrawnCards = false;` to the resetGameState function

By adding this simple line, we fixed the main issue that was preventing cards from being played. The game now properly allows playing cards after drawing.
