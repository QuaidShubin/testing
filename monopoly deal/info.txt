Monetary (Bank) Value: 0M (none)
Effect: May represent any color property (Brown, Light Blue, Pink, Orange, Red, Yellow, Green, Dark Blue, Railroad, or Utility).
Notes: It cannot be used alone to form a complete set unless at least one standard property card of that color is also present (depending on house rules).
Usage Notes
Switching Colors: On your turn, you may reassign a two‐color or ten‐color wildcard from one color to another (e.g., flipping it from Orange to Purple) if it’s already in your property area.
Banking: Except for the ten‐color wildcard, these two‐color wildcards do have a monetary value and can be placed in your bank as money. Once banked, they lose their “property” function.
Paying Debts: You can pay an opponent with a wildcard only if it has a bank value (the ten‐color wildcard cannot be used to pay at all).
