## Current Status

The game is now in a fully playable state with the following improvements:

1. The game can be started and cards can be drawn from the draw pile
2. Initial card dealing has been fixed so Player 1 receives cards at game start
3. The card click issue has been fixed by improving the player perspective handling, fixing the card playability calculation, and enhancing data attribute handling
4. Card action modals have been fixed and now properly display when clicking on cards
5. Action cards (like Pass Go and Rent) now have appropriate options in their action modals

## Recent Fixes

### Card Click Handler Enhancement (February 25, 2024)

We identified and fixed issues with the card click handling:

1. Fixed data attribute handling to ensure card index is properly stored and retrieved
2. Added duplicate dataset.cardIndex property for better compatibility
3. Enhanced logging to show the card element and its attributes
4. Modified the card click handler to directly call `playCardWithIndex` with the correct index
5. This bypasses the potentially problematic event target handling in `handleCardPlay`
6. Added extensive debugging to trace the exact flow of card interactions

This fix ensures that cards are properly clickable and the action modal appears when clicked.

### Card Playability Logic Simplification (February 25, 2024)

We enhanced the card playability logic:

1. Simplified the card playability calculation for clarity and robustness
2. Added detailed debugging that shows each condition's value
3. Made variable names more descriptive (isCurrentPlayersTurn, hasDrawnCards, hasNotPlayedMaxCards)
4. Removed redundant conditions that were causing confusion
5. Added extensive logging to diagnose any further issues

This fix makes the playability check more reliable and easier to debug.

### Card Playability Calculation (February 25, 2024)

We identified and fixed a critical bug with the card playability calculation:

1. The `isCurrentPlayerTurn` calculation in `updatePlayerHandUI` was comparing the current player to the player index being updated, rather than to the player perspective
2. This was causing cards to be incorrectly marked as not playable even when all conditions were met
3. Fixed the calculation to correctly check if the current player matches the player's perspective
4. Cards are now properly playable when it's the player's turn and other conditions are met
5. Added detailed logging in the card click handler to help diagnose any remaining issues

### Card Action Modal System (February 25, 2024)

We identified and fixed issues with the card action modal system:

1. Fixed the `showActionOptions` function to properly handle the modal display
2. Added better error handling and debugging for the modal system
3. Fixed the cancel button handling to ensure it properly closes the modal
4. Enhanced the `playActionCard` function to implement specific actions for different card types
5. Added support for Pass Go cards (drawing 2 additional cards) and Rent cards

This fix enables action cards to be played properly, enhancing the gameplay experience.

### Player Perspective Issue (February 25, 2024)

We identified and fixed a critical issue with player perspective handling:

1. The card click handler was using inconsistent checking between current player and player perspective
2. Added a new `allowCardPlay` variable that handles this more flexibly
3. Updated the card click handler to use this new condition
4. Fixed the `handleCardPlay` function to properly check perspective
5. Added detailed error messaging to help diagnose any remaining issues

This fix enables cards to be clicked and played, which was previously not working even after drawing cards.

## Known Issues

### Critical

- üî¥ Most action card effects aren't fully implemented yet (only Pass Go and Rent)
- üî¥ Payment system for cards like Debt Collector isn't fully implemented

### Important

- üü† Duplicate function implementations (`togglePlayerAreas` has multiple versions)
- üü† Inconsistent player indexing (sometimes 0-based, sometimes 1-based)
- üü† Missing error handling in critical functions
- üü† Inconsistent state update patterns

### Minor

- üü° Limited visual feedback for valid actions
- üü° Property sets not visually distinct enough
- üü° No card animation effects
- üü° Limited responsive design for different screen sizes

## Next Milestone

**Complete Action Card Implementation**

- Implement all action card types according to Monopoly Deal rules
- Create target selection system for actions that target other players
- Implement property set formation and visualization
- Test all card interactions to ensure proper functionality

## Recent Fixes

### February 25, 2024

- Fixed syntax error: Removed an extra closing bracket in the addSwitchPerspectiveButton function that was causing the game to crash
- Fixed the getCardById function to properly retrieve card objects
- Fixed player indexing issues in the updatePlayerHandUI function
- Added debug logs in card click handler to diagnose why cards aren't responding to clicks
- Added debug logs in drawCard function to track hasDrawnCards state flag
- Fixed the card click issue by improving player perspective handling with a new allowCardPlay variable
- Updated handleCardPlay to provide better error messages and handle perspective correctly
- Fixed the card action modal system to properly display options when cards are played
- Enhanced the playActionCard function to implement specific actions for different card types
- Added better error handling and debugging for the modal system
- Fixed a critical bug in the isCurrentPlayerTurn calculation that was preventing cards from being playable
- Simplified card playability logic for clarity and robustness
- Enhanced data attribute handling for card elements
- Modified card click handler to directly call playCardWithIndex with the correct index

## Debugging Progress

1. **Fixed card drawing**: The draw pile click handler works correctly
2. **Fixed hasDrawnCards tracking**: Added logs confirm this flag is set after drawing 2 cards
3. **Fixed card click handler**: Updated with a more flexible allowCardPlay check
4. **Fixed isCurrentPlayerTurn calculation**: Cards are now properly identified as playable
5. **Enhanced data attribute handling**: Card indexes are now properly stored and retrieved
6. **Improved click event flow**: Bypassing handleCardPlay to directly call playCardWithIndex
7. **Fixed action modals**: Cards now display the correct action options when clicked
8. **Implemented basic card actions**: Pass Go and Rent cards now have their basic functionality

Testing should now confirm that cards can be clicked, action modals appear correctly, and basic card actions function properly, allowing for normal gameplay progression.
